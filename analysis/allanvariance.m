%% Inertial Sensor Noise Analysis Using Allan Variance
% This example shows how to use the Allan variance to determine noise
% parameters of a MEMS gyroscope. These parameters can be used to model the 
% gyroscope in simulation. The gyroscope measurement is modeled as:
%
% $$\Omega(t) = \Omega_{Ideal}(t) + Bias_N(t) + Bias_B(t) + Bias_K(t)$$
%
% The three noise parameters _N_ (angle random walk), _K_ (rate random
% walk), and _B_ (bias instability) are estimated using data logged from a
% stationary gyroscope.

%% Background
% Allan variance was originally developed by David W. Allan to measure the 
% frequency stability of precision oscillators. It can also be used to 
% identify various noise sources present in stationary gyroscope 
% measurements. Consider _L_ samples of data from a gyroscope with a sample 
% time of $\tau_{0}$. Form data clusters of durations $\tau_{0}$, 
% $2\tau_{0}$, ..., $m\tau_{0}, (m < (L-1)/2)$ and obtain the averages of 
% the sum of the data points contained in each cluster over the length of 
% the cluster. The Allan variance is defined as the two-sample variance of 
% the data cluster averages as a function of cluster time. This example 
% uses the overlapping Allan variance estimator. This means that the 
% calculated clusters are overlapping. The estimator performs better than 
% non-overlapping estimators for larger values of _L_.

%% Allan Variance Calculation
% The Allan variance is calculated as follows:
% 
% Log _L_ stationary gyroscope samples with a sample period $\tau_{0}$. Let 
% $\Omega$ be the logged samples. 

% Load logged data from one axis of a three-axis gyroscope. This recording
% was done over a six hour period with a 100 Hz sampling rate. 
% load('LoggedSingleAxisGyroscope', 'omega', 'Fs')
Fs = 40;

orientation_x = data{:,6};
orientation_y = data{:,7};
orientation_z = data{:,8};

%%
% 
% For each sample, calculate the output angle $\theta$:
%
% $$\theta(t) = \int^{t}\Omega(t')dt'$$
%
% For discrete samples, the cumulative sum multiplied by $\tau_{0}$ can be
% used.
theta = cumsum(omega, 1)*t0;
%%
%
% Next, calculate the Allan variance:
%
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) =
% \frac{1}{2\tau^2}<(\theta_{k+2m}-2\theta_{k+m}+\theta_{k})^2>$$
%
% where $\tau = m\tau_{0}$ and $<>$ is the ensemble average. 
%
% The ensemble average can be expanded to:
% 
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) =
% \frac{1}{2\tau^2(L-2m)}\sum_{k=1}^{L-2m}(\theta_{k+2m} - 2\theta_{k+m}
% + \theta_{k})^2$$

maxNumM = 100;
L = size(theta, 1);

%% Noise Parameter Identification
% To obtain the noise parameters for the gyroscope, use the following 
% relationship between the Allan variance and the two-sided power spectral
% density (PSD) of the noise parameters in the original data set $\Omega$. 
% The relationship is:
%%
% 
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) = 4\int_{0}^{\infty}S_\Omega(f)
% \frac{sin^4(\pi f\tau)}{(\pi f\tau)^2}df$$
% 
% From the above equation, the Allan variance is proportional to the total
% noise power of the gyroscope when passed through a filter with a transfer
% function of $sin^4(x)/(x)^2$. This transfer function arises from the 
% operations done to create and operate on the clusters. 
%
% Using this transfer function interpretation, the filter bandpass depends 
% on $\tau$. This means that different noise parameters can be identified 
% by changing the filter bandpass, or varying $\tau$.

%% Angle Random Walk
% The angle random walk is characterized by the white noise spectrum of the
% gyroscope output. The PSD is represented by: 
%%
%
% $$S_\Omega(f) = N^2$$
%
% where
%
% _N_ = angle random walk coefficient
%
% Substituting into the original PSD equation and performing integration 
% yields:
%%
%
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) = \frac{N^2}{\tau}$$
%
% The above equation is a line with a slope of -1/2 when plotted on a
% log-log plot of $\sigma(\tau)$ versus $\tau$. The value of _N_ can be
% read directly off of this line at $\tau = 1$. The units of _N_ are
% $(rad/s)/\sqrt{Hz}$.

% Find the index where the slope of the log-scaled Allan deviation is equal

%% Rate Random Walk
% The rate random walk is characterized by the red noise (Brownian noise) 
% spectrum of the gyroscope output. The PSD is represented by:

%
% $$S_\Omega(f) = (\frac{K}{2\pi})^2\frac{1}{f^2}$$
%
% where

% _K_ = rate random walk coefficient
%

% yields:
%%
%
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) = \frac{K^2\tau}{3}$$
%
% The above equation is a line with a slope of 1/2 when plotted on a
% log-log plot of $\sigma(\tau)$ versus $\tau$. The value of _K_ can be
% read directly off of this line at $\tau = 3$. The units of _K_ are

%% Bias Instability
% The bias instability is characterized by the pink noise (flicker noise) 
% spectrum of the gyroscope output. The PSD is represented by:
%%
%
% $$S_{\Omega}(f) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}(\frac{B^2}{2\pi})\frac{1}{f} 
% & : f \leq f_0\\0 & : f > f_0\end{array}\right.$$
%
% where
%
% _B_ = bias instability coefficient
%
% $f_0$ = cut-off frequency
%
% Substituting into the original PSD equation and performing integration 
% yields:
%%
%
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) = \frac{2B^2}{\pi}[\ln{2} + \\
% -\frac{sin^3x}{2x^2}(sinx + 4xcosx) + Ci(2x) - Ci(4x)]$$
%
% where
%
% $x = \pi f_0\tau$
%
% _Ci_ = cosine-integral function
%
% When $\tau$ is much longer than the inverse of the cutoff frequency, the 
% PSD equation is:
%%
%
% $$\sigma^2(\tau) = \frac{2B^2}{\pi}\ln{2}$$
%
% The above equation is a line with a slope of 0 when plotted on a log-log
% plot of $\sigma(\tau)$ versus $\tau$. The value of _B_ can be read
% directly off of this line with a scaling of $\sqrt{\frac{2\ln{2}}{\pi}}
% \approx 0.664$. The units of _B_ are $rad/s$.

% The plot shows that the gyroscope model created from the |imuSensor| 
% generates measurements with similar Allan deviation to the logged data. 
% The model measurements contain slightly less noise since the quantization

% The gyroscope model can be used to generate measurements using movements 
% that are not easily captured with hardware.
